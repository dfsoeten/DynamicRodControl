# Dynamic Rod Control
Dynamic Rod Control is a program written in LUA for a modded version of the Minecraft client.

This program hooks into 10 reactors which are setup in-game, so they function as one. This means these reactors are extremely power efficient!

The following features are implemented
- Shows active power output on the monitor.
- RF/T output changes color based on how much the reactors output. 
- Reactors will shut down if no power is needed, the reactors wont use fuel in this case!
